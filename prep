{Notes: In business, the management team tends to cite the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) Model
and then ask for corresponding action plans. From this ‘Frame setting’ when I try to study Options and Real Options, I paid
extra attention to these uncertainty relevant concepts and then dive deeper to the scientific methods.}

NPV is a Yes or No question, real options smoothes it, similar to 'linearrelaxation' between two integers, there're other options: to defer,
to expand, to contract: early exercise...
